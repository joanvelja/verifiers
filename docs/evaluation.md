Use `prime eval` to execute rollouts against any supported model provider and report aggregate metrics. Supported providers include OpenAI-compatible APIs (the default) and the Anthropic Messages API (via `--api-client-type anthropic_messages`).

## Basic Usage

Environments must be installed as Python packages before evaluation. From a local environment:

```bash
prime env install my-env           # installs ./environments/my_env as a package
prime eval run my-env -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini -n 10
```

`prime eval` imports the environment module using Python's import system, calls its `load_environment()` function, runs 5 examples with 3 rollouts each (the default), scores them using the environment's rubric, and prints aggregate metrics.

## Hosted Evaluations

You can also run evaluations on Prime-managed infrastructure with `prime eval run --hosted`. Hosted evaluations require an environment that has already been published to the Environments Hub, and they are useful when you want Prime to manage execution, monitor logs remotely, or run against a shared Hub environment slug instead of a local package.

```bash
prime env push my-env
prime eval run my-env --hosted
prime eval run my-env --hosted --follow
```

Hosted runs also support TOML configs:

```bash
prime eval run configs/eval/benchmark-hosted.toml --hosted
```

For the full hosted workflow and hosted-only flags such as `--follow`, `--timeout-minutes`, `--allow-sandbox-access`, and `--custom-secrets`, see the official [Hosted Evaluations](https://docs.primeintellect.ai/tutorials-environments/hosted-evaluations) guide.

## Command Reference

### Environment Selection

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `env_id_or_path` | (positional) | — | Environment ID(s) or path to TOML config |
| `--env-args` | `-a` | `{}` | JSON object passed to `load_environment()` |
| `--extra-env-kwargs` | `-x` | `{}` | JSON object passed to environment constructor |
| `--env-dir-path` | `-p` | `./environments` | Base path for saving output files |

The positional argument accepts two formats:
- **Single environment**: `gsm8k` — evaluates one environment
- **TOML config path**: `configs/eval/benchmark.toml` — evaluates multiple environments defined in the config file

Environment IDs are converted to Python module names (`my-env` → `my_env`) and imported. Modules must be installed (via `prime env install` or `uv pip install`).

The `--env-args` flag passes arguments to your `load_environment()` function:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -a '{"difficulty": "hard", "num_examples": 100}'
```

The `--extra-env-kwargs` flag passes arguments directly to the environment constructor, useful for overriding defaults like `max_turns` which may not be exposed via `load_environment()`:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -x '{"max_turns": 20}'
```

#### Executor autoscaling

Thread-pool executors are automatically sized to match the evaluation concurrency. During `prime eval run`, if `concurrency` is not explicitly provided via `--extra-env-kwargs`, it is computed from the concurrency level (`max_concurrent`, or `num_examples * rollouts_per_example` when unlimited) using `recommended_max_workers()`. This value is passed to `Environment.set_concurrency()`, which resizes both the default event-loop executor and all registered executors.

To override the automatic value:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -x '{"concurrency": 256}'
```

You can also call `set_concurrency()` directly at runtime:

```python
env.set_concurrency(256)
```

### Model Configuration

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--model` | `-m` | `openai/gpt-4.1-mini` | Model name or endpoint alias |
| `--api-base-url` | `-b` | `https://api.pinference.ai/api/v1` | API base URL |
| `--api-key-var` | `-k` | `PRIME_API_KEY` | Environment variable containing API key |
| `--api-client-type` | — | `openai_chat_completions` | Client type: `openai_chat_completions`, `openai_completions`, `openai_chat_completions_token`, or `anthropic_messages` |
| `--endpoints-path` | `-e` | `./configs/endpoints.toml` | Path to TOML endpoints registry |
| `--header` | — | — | Extra HTTP header (`Name: Value`), repeatable |

For convenience, define model endpoints in `./configs/endpoints.toml` to avoid repeating URL and key flags.

```toml
[[endpoint]]
endpoint_id = "gpt-4.1-mini"
model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
url = "https://api.openai.com/v1"
key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"

[[endpoint]]
endpoint_id = "qwen3-235b-i"
model = "qwen/qwen3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507"
url = "https://api.pinference.ai/api/v1"
key = "PRIME_API_KEY"

[[endpoint]]
endpoint_id = "claude-sonnet"
model = "claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929"
url = "https://api.anthropic.com"
key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
api_client_type = "anthropic_messages"
```

Each endpoint entry supports an optional `api_client_type` field to select the client implementation (defaults to `"openai_chat_completions"`). Use `"anthropic_messages"` for Anthropic models when calling the Anthropic API directly.

Optional HTTP headers for inference requests use a short TOML key `headers` (inline table). The alias `extra_headers` is accepted with the same shape; do not set both on one row.

```toml
[[endpoint]]
endpoint_id = "my-proxy"
model = "gpt-4.1-mini"
url = "https://api.example/v1"
key = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
headers = { "X-Custom-Header" = "value" }
```

In `[[eval]]` TOML configs you can set extra headers as `headers = { ... }` and/or as a list `header = ["Name: Value", ...]` (same form as repeated `--header`). Merge order is: registry row, then the `headers` table, then each `header` / `--header` line, with later entries overriding the same name.

In addition to user-specified headers, `prime eval` automatically includes an `X-Session-ID` header on every inference request, set to the `example_id` from the rollout state. This enables sticky routing at the inference router level when supported.

To define equivalent replicas, add multiple `[[endpoint]]` entries with the same `endpoint_id`.

Then use the alias directly:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -m qwen3-235b-i
```

If the model name is in the registry, those values are used by default, but you can override them with `--api-base-url` and/or `--api-key-var`. If the model name isn't found, the CLI flags are used (falling back to defaults when omitted).

In other words, `-m/--model` is treated as an endpoint alias lookup when present in the registry, and otherwise treated as a literal model id.

When using eval TOML configs, you can set `endpoint_id` in `[[eval]]` sections to resolve from the endpoint registry. `endpoint_id` is only supported when `endpoints_path` points to a TOML registry file.

### Sampling Parameters

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-tokens` | `-t` | model default | Maximum tokens to generate |
| `--temperature` | `-T` | model default | Sampling temperature |
| `--sampling-args` | `-S` | — | JSON object for additional sampling parameters |

The `--sampling-args` flag accepts any parameters supported by the model's API:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -S '{"temperature": 0.7, "top_p": 0.9}'
```

### Evaluation Scope

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--num-examples` | `-n` | 5 | Number of dataset examples to evaluate |
| `--rollouts-per-example` | `-r` | 3 | Rollouts per example (for pass@k, variance) |

Multiple rollouts per example enable metrics like pass@k and help measure variance. The total number of rollouts is `num_examples × rollouts_per_example`.

### Concurrency

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--max-concurrent` | `-c` | 32 | Maximum concurrent requests |
| `--max-concurrent-generation` | — | same as `-c` | Concurrent generation requests |
| `--max-concurrent-scoring` | — | same as `-c` | Concurrent scoring requests |
| `--no-interleave-scoring` | `-N` | false | Disable interleaved scoring |
| `--independent-scoring` | `-i` | false | Score each rollout individually instead of by group |
| `--max-retries` | — | 0 | Retries per rollout on transient `InfraError` |
| `--num-workers` | `-w` | `auto` | Number of env server worker processes (`auto` = concurrency ÷ 256, minimum 1) |

By default, scoring runs interleaved with generation. Use `--no-interleave-scoring` to score all rollouts after generation completes.

The `--max-retries` flag enables automatic retry with exponential backoff when rollouts fail due to transient infrastructure errors (e.g., sandbox timeouts, API failures).

The `--num-workers` flag controls how many worker processes the env server spawns. Each worker owns its own environment instance and runs rollouts independently. The default `auto` scales with concurrency.

### Display

When evaluating multiple environments, the display shows an overview panel at the top with a compact status line per environment, and a detail panel below with full progress, metrics, and logs for one environment at a time. Use the **left/right arrow keys** to switch between environments. The overview scrolls to keep the selected environment visible and is capped at half the terminal height.

### Output and Saving

| Flag | Short | Default | Description |
|------|-------|---------|-------------|
| `--verbose` | `-v` | false | Enable debug logging |
| `--tui` | `-u` | false | Use alternate screen mode (TUI) for display |
| `--debug` | `-d` | false | Disable Rich display; use normal logging and tqdm progress |
| `--abbreviated-summary` | `-A` | false | Abbreviated summary: show settings and stats, skip example prompts |
| `--output-dir` | `-o` | — | Custom output directory for evaluation results and logs |
| `--save-results` | `-s` | false | Save results to disk |
| `--resume [PATH]` | `-R` | — | Resume from a previous run (auto-detect latest matching incomplete run if PATH omitted) |
| `--state-columns` | `-C` | — | Extra state columns to save (comma-separated) |
| `--save-to-hf-hub` | `-H` | false | Push results to Hugging Face Hub |
| `--hf-hub-dataset-name` | `-D` | — | Dataset name for HF Hub |
| `--heartbeat-url` | — | — | Heartbeat URL for uptime monitoring |

By default, results are saved to `./outputs/evals/{env_id}--{model}/{run_id}/`. Use `--output-dir` to override the base output directory — when set, results (and logs) are saved under `{output_dir}/evals/{env_id}--{model}/{run_id}/` instead. The directory contains:

- `results.jsonl` — rollout outputs, one per line
- `metadata.json` — evaluation configuration and aggregate metrics

### Resuming Evaluations

Long-running evaluations can be interrupted and resumed using checkpointing. When `--save-results` is enabled, results are saved incrementally after each completed group of rollouts. Use `--resume` to continue from where you left off. Pass a path to resume a specific run, or omit the path to auto-detect the latest incomplete matching run.

**Running with checkpoints:**

```bash
prime eval run my-env -n 1000 -s
```

With `-s` (save results) enabled, partial results are written to disk after each group completes. If the evaluation is interrupted, the output directory will contain all completed rollouts up until the interruption.

**Resuming from a checkpoint:**

```bash
prime eval run my-env -n 1000 -s --resume ./environments/my_env/outputs/evals/my-env--openai--gpt-4.1-mini/abc12345
```

When a resume path is provided, it must point to a valid evaluation results directory containing both `results.jsonl` and `metadata.json`. With `--resume` and no path, verifiers scans the environment/model output directory and picks the most recent incomplete run matching `env_id`, `model`, and `rollouts_per_example` where saved `num_examples` is less than or equal to the current run. When resuming:

1. Existing completed rollouts are loaded from the checkpoint
2. Remaining rollouts are computed based on the example ids and group size
3. Only incomplete rollouts are executed
4. New results are appended to the existing checkpoint

If all rollouts are already complete, the evaluation returns immediately with the existing results.

**Configuration compatibility:**

When resuming, the current run configuration should match the original run. Mismatches in parameters like `--model`, `--env-args`, or `--rollouts-per-example` can lead to undefined behavior. For reliable results, resume with the same configuration used to create the checkpoint, only increasing `--num-examples` if you need additional rollouts beyond the original target.

**Example workflow:**

```bash
# Start a large evaluation with checkpointing
prime eval run math-python -n 500 -r 3 -s

# If interrupted, find the run directory
ls ./environments/math_python/outputs/evals/math-python--openai--gpt-4.1-mini/

# Resume from the checkpoint
prime eval run math-python -n 500 -r 3 -s \
  --resume ./environments/math_python/outputs/evals/math-python--openai--gpt-4.1-mini/abc12345
```

The `--state-columns` flag allows saving environment-specific state fields that your environment stores during rollouts:

```bash
prime eval run my-env -s -C "judge_response,parsed_answer"
```

## Environment Defaults

Environments can specify default evaluation parameters in their `pyproject.toml` (See [Developing Environments](environments.md#developing-environments)):

```toml
[tool.verifiers.eval]
num_examples = 100
rollouts_per_example = 5
```

These defaults are used when higher-priority sources don't specify a value. The full priority order is:

1. TOML per-environment settings (when using a config file)
2. CLI flags
3. Environment defaults (from `pyproject.toml`)
4. Global defaults

See [Configuration Precedence](#configuration-precedence) for more details on multi-environment evaluation.

## Multi-Environment Evaluation

You can evaluate multiple environments using `prime eval` with a TOML configuration file. This is useful for running comprehensive benchmark suites.

### TOML Configuration

For multi-environment evals or fine-grained control over settings, use a TOML configuration file. When using a config file, CLI arguments are ignored.

```bash
prime eval run configs/eval/my-benchmark.toml
```

The TOML file uses `[[eval]]` sections to define each evaluation. You can also specify global defaults at the top:

```toml
# configs/eval/my-benchmark.toml

# Global defaults (optional)
model = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
num_examples = 50

[[eval]]
env_id = "gsm8k"
num_examples = 100  # overrides global default
rollouts_per_example = 5

[[eval]]
env_id = "alphabet-sort"
# Uses global num_examples (50)
rollouts_per_example = 3

[[eval]]
env_id = "math-python"
# Uses global defaults and built-in defaults for unspecified values
```

A minimal config requires only a single `[[eval]]` section:

```toml
[[eval]]
env_id = "gsm8k"
```

Each `[[eval]]` section must contain an `env_id` field. All other fields are optional:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `env_id` | string | **Required.** Environment module name |
| `env_args` | table | Arguments passed to `load_environment()` |
| `num_examples` | integer | Number of dataset examples to evaluate |
| `rollouts_per_example` | integer | Rollouts per example |
| `extra_env_kwargs` | table | Arguments passed to environment constructor |
| `model` | string | Model to evaluate |
| `endpoint_id` | string | Endpoint registry id (requires TOML `endpoints_path`) |

Example with `env_args`:

```toml
[[eval]]
env_id = "math-python"
num_examples = 50

[eval.env_args]
difficulty = "hard"
split = "test"
```

### Ablation Sweeps

Use `[[ablation]]` blocks to automatically generate eval configs from a cartesian product of parameter values. This is useful for hyperparameter sweeps and ablation studies without manually writing each combination.

```toml
# Global defaults apply to all evals and ablations
model = "openai/gpt-4.1-mini"
num_examples = 50

# Sweep temperature × difficulty → 6 eval configs
# split is fixed across all combinations
[[ablation]]
env_id = "my-env"
env_args = {split = "test"}

[ablation.sweep]
temperature = [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]

[ablation.sweep.env_args]
difficulty = ["easy", "hard"]
```

- **Fixed fields** in the `[[ablation]]` block (like `env_id`) apply to all expanded configs
- **`[ablation.sweep]`** keys are lists of values crossed as a cartesian product
- **`[ablation.sweep.env_args]`** keys are swept and merged into the `env_args` dict
- **Fixed `env_args`** can be set alongside swept ones (e.g. `env_args = {split = "test"}` keeps `split` fixed while sweeping other env args). The same key cannot appear in both fixed and swept env_args.
- Multiple `[[ablation]]` blocks are independent (no cross-product between blocks)
- `[[ablation]]` and `[[eval]]` blocks can coexist in the same config file
- `env_id` can be a fixed field or a sweep key (e.g. `env_id = ["env-a", "env-b"]`), but note that all swept envs must accept the same `env_args` — use separate `[[ablation]]` blocks for envs with different argument schemas

Use `--abbreviated-summary` (`-A`) to get a compact summary focused on settings and stats, which is useful when comparing many ablation runs.

### Configuration Precedence

When using a **config file**, CLI arguments are ignored. Settings are resolved as:

1. **TOML per-eval settings** — Values specified in `[[eval]]` sections
2. **TOML global settings** — Values at the top of the config file
3. **Environment defaults** — Values from the environment's `pyproject.toml`
4. **Built-in defaults** — (`num_examples=5`, `rollouts_per_example=3`)

When using **CLI only** (no config file), settings are resolved as:

1. **CLI arguments** — Flags passed on the command line
2. **Environment defaults** — Values from the environment's `pyproject.toml`
3. **Built-in defaults** — (`num_examples=5`, `rollouts_per_example=3`)
