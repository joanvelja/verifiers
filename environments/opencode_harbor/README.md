# opencode-harbor

### Overview
- **Environment ID**: `opencode-harbor`
- **Short description**: Environment for running an agent with OpenCode on Harbor tasks
- **Tags**: opencode, cli_agent, harbor

### Datasets
- **Primary dataset(s)**: Harbor tasks
- **Source links**: <https://github.com/laude-institute/harbor>
- **Split sizes**: 11 bundled tasks

### Task
- **Type**: multiturn, cli_agent
- **Rubric overview**: Binary, returned by running task tests

### Quickstart
Run the environment:

```bash
prime eval run opencode-harbor
```

Configure model and sampling:

```bash
prime eval run opencode-harbor -m openai/gpt-4.1-mini -n 20 -r 3 -t 1024 -T 0.7
```

Notes:
- Use `-a` / `--env-args` for flat environment arguments.
- Use `taskset` and `harness` config sections for v1 object configuration.

### Environment Arguments

| Arg | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| `task_names` | list[str] | `null` | Explicit Harbor task names to run. |
| `dataset` | str | `null` | Harbor Hub dataset id. Defaults to bundled `tasks/`. |

OpenCode settings belong under the v1 harness config:

```toml
[env.harness]
max_turns = 4
agent_workdir = "/app"
```

This environment does not set a custom disabled-tool list. It inherits the
`vf.OpenCodeConfig` defaults.

### Metrics
Summarize key metrics your rubric emits and how they’re interpreted.

| Metric | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| `reward` | Main scalar reward (weighted sum of criteria) |


## How It Works

1. `vf.HarborTaskset` loads Harbor task rows and contributes sandbox settings,
   task uploads, env vars, and the Harbor reward.
2. `vf.OpenCode` contributes the reusable OpenCode CLI program, install/setup,
   intercepted endpoint config, MCP tool proxy, and log artifact collection.
3. The v1 runtime resolves both sides into one sandboxed command program at rollout time.
4. Reward is computed by running the Harbor test scripts after the rollout.

`HarborTaskset` and `OpenCode` are packaged under `verifiers.v1.packages` and
re-exported from `verifiers.v1`.

## Requirements

- Harbor tasks directory with `task.toml` and `instruction.md` files
- Docker images specified in task configs


## Reward

Uses Harbor's standard reward mechanism:

- Runs `tests/test.sh` after agent completion
- Reads reward from `/logs/verifier/reward.txt` or `/logs/verifier/reward.json`
- Returns float reward value (typically 0 or 1)

## Notes

- OpenCode is installed at runtime.
- Agent logs are saved to `/logs/agent/opencode.txt` in the sandbox
- Uses `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible` provider for API interception
