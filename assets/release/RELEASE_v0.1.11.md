# Verifiers v0.1.11 Release Notes

*Date:* 03/12/2026

**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/verifiers/compare/v0.1.10...v0.1.11

## Highlights since v0.1.10

- Unified the client stack around shared client abstractions, with better multimodal handling, provider defaults, token accounting, and more consistent response/error behavior.
- Reworked `RLMEnv` and rollout execution with sandbox-only execution, shared interception pools, `RolloutGatewayMixin`, tunnel reuse and recovery, and clearer model message history and debug logs.
- Improved evaluation ergonomics with heartbeat monitoring, a refined multi-environment TUI, overview and settings panels, abbreviated summaries, richer detail headers, and cleaner Rich log rendering.
- Hardened env server and sandbox reliability with spawn-based sidecars, deadlock and crash recovery, client cancellation propagation, safer teardown and cleanup paths, optional env server opt-out, and configurable HTTP connect timeouts.
- Added new evaluation and environment capabilities including pass@k and pass^k metrics, router replay, `[[ablation]]` eval sweep syntax, single-file environment imports, and bundled opencode environments and utilities.
